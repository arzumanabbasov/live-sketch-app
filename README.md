# Live Sketch

Live Sketch is a Python program that applies a sketch-like effect to live video from a camera feed using the OpenCV library. It captures video frames, processes each frame using image filtering and manipulation techniques, and displays the resulting live sketch in a window.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library `pip install opencv-python`

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the OpenCV library by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: `pip install opencv-python`
3. Download or clone the project source code.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
5. Run the following command to start the Live Sketch program: `python main.py`
6. The program will access the default camera and display the live sketch in a window.
7. Press 'q' to quit the program and close the window.
